# Project Structure

This Next.js application follows a structured organization:

## Directory Organization

- `src/app/`: Contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - Each page route has its own directory with `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, etc.
  - Page-specific components go in `app/[page]/components/`

- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `components/ui/`: Shadcn components
  - `components/layout/`: Layout components like `window.tsx`
  - `components/apps/`: Application feature components

- `src/atoms/`: State management with Jotai atoms
  - Each atom or related group of atoms should be in separate files

- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - Named according to their functionality (e.g., `useWindowSize.ts`)

- `src/utils/`: Utility functions
  - Including `storage.ts` for local storage operations

- `src/config/`: Configuration files
  - Contains `appRegistry.ts` for app/feature registration

- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - Shared types and interfaces used across the application

- `src/styles/`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration
  - Includes `globals.css` for application-wide styles

- `src/lib/`: Shared libraries and integrations
  - External service integrations and wrappers

  ### Key Files
- `/src/config/appRegistry.ts`: Registry for all apps and features
- `/src/utils/storage.ts`: Helpers for local storage persistence
- `/src/components/layout/window.tsx`: Reusable window layout for apps
- `/src/styles/globals.css`: Global styling
